# Fast_Rendering_Plenoctrees
3D reconstrucBon using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is computaBonally intensive, making it unsuitable for real-Bme applicaBons. The plenOctree offers a promising soluBon by enabling real-Bme rendering. This project aims to replicate plenOctree and test its capabiliBes to render NeRF models in a web browser for custom data.
