# Fast_Rendering_Plenoctrees
3D reconstruction using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is computationally intensive, making it unsuitable for real-time applicaBons. The plenOctree offers a promising soluBon by enabling real-time rendering. This project aims to replicate plenOctree and test its capabilities to render NeRF models in a web browser for custom data.
